    "description": "I'm a student specializing in backend development, with a strong passion for writing efficient, high-performance code. C++ is my favorite and most frequently used language, and I enjoy leveraging its power to build robust systems. Alongside backend work, I'm also comfortable working across the stack when neededâ€”I have experience with technologies like Next.js, React.js, Flutter, plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Java, and C. I'm always eager to learn, optimize, and push the boundaries of what I can build.",
